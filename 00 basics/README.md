# Basics

The first part deals with the basic components of the language Go.

Especially the first examples are often kept so small that the code itself is already the best documentation.

First I take a look at the unique selling points of the language.

Afterwards I am interested in the testability and documentability. This aspect is covered in detail in the last two parts.
